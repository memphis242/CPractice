From what you installed with Cygwin, your compiler is x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc.

However, it looks like somehow "gcc" was setup to also call "x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc"? Idk. Anyways,

---------------------------------------------------------------
Basic command to compile:

gcc -o <name_of_program> <name_of_source_file>

--------------------------------------------------------------
Basic gdb debug: ( use Cygwyn terminal for this... for some reason, gdb invoked by git bash has missing commands as of 06/15/2023. gdb version in Cygwin is GNU gdb (GDB) (Cygwin 11.2-1) 11.2. gdb version in git bash is GNU gdb (GDB) 8.2.1. )

gcc -o <name_of_program> <name_of_source_file> -g

gdb ./<name_of_proram>
lay next		// To change layout; hit enter a few times to cycle through different layouts

Once in gdb session,
break <function_name or line number> 	--> Sets a breakpoint
clear <breakpoint>			--> Removes a breakpoint
watch <variable_name>			--> Breakpoint at change of a variable
display <variable_name>			--> Print value of variable every step/next
print <variable_name>			--> Prints value of a variable
run 					--> runs the program until breakpoint or exit
continue				--> runs after breakpoint until next breakpoint or exit
next					--> Steps over a function
step					--> Steps into a function
<enter>					--> Execute last command entered
ref					--> Refresh screen (might be necessary after prints)
x/i $pc					--> Examine instruction at program counter
info registers				--> Examine registers
list <line_number>			--> Look at code currently executing
exit					--> Quits gdb session
